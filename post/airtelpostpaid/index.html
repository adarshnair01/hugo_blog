    <div class="content">
      <p>I am very disappointed with the service that Airtel Customer care have provided and equally disappointed with the service I have received from their store. They’re literally looting my money and I have to wait for their help because there’s nothing that I can do, other than posting it online.</p>
<h2 id="journey-on-pushpak-viman-to-postpaid">Journey on Pushpak Viman To Postpaid</h2>
<p>Here’s what I have been through after I thought to move to postpaid. Once I checked Airtel’s website and came to know they have good plans in postpaid with very high data usage which can be used, I tried registering for an airtel postpaid connection online. I faced difficulties and was not able to port it then. But to my surprise after an hour, I got a call from airtel customer care asking whether I was looking to change to Postpaid plan. Based on the reviews from people, I thought to give it a go. To my surprise, in 2-3 hrs airtel executive came to my home to provide me with a new postpaid connection sim. Every procedure was done in 15mins and he also handed me a new sim card. In 4-5 days my postpaid connection was active. By this time, I thought WOW what a service. This is what I expect from India’s number one customer-centric telecom company is about.</p>
<h2 id="a-month-of-vanvas">A month of Vanvas</h2>
<p>Now after a month of usage, I got to know that, I am severely underutilizing my postpaid plan and all the options in <strong>My airtel app</strong> are not working. The best part is when I start using data from my Airtel Sim which has 75 GB of data speed turned out to be in KBs even though it is a 4G sim. I did not make more than 10 calls a month and Data usage is almost nil. All thanks to the speed I get from Airtel.</p>
<h2 id="phool-baney-angaray">Phool baney angaray</h2>
<p>The best part is after using airtel postpaid sim card for a month, I planned to change my postpaid Sim card to prepaid. But then when I visit their store, gues what the executive tells me, sir, it is not possible to port because you have not used it for 3 months. I wasted an hour to visit your store and to think about what will I do in this situation. Now, the only option left to me is paying all the extra charges. I came up with a solution to stop my card and deactivate it as I do not want to waste money that can be used for a year, at once to pay 2 months bill just for 10 calls that can be done in any other network in max 10rs. I called customer care support, they asked me the reason to change to prepaid. They told me I can opt for a lower plan of 299 instead of 499(My current plan). But even if I start using 299 plan I will still be underutilizing. After giving it thought, I planned to go with the option to deactivate my Sim only at that time, I was told that if I want to port from airtel postpaid to prepaid, there was no need to wait for 3 months it can be done after 1 month of usage. That moment I was dumbstruck to what I have heard. I told them about my encounter at airtel store. They told me to visit again and call customer care from the store if he denied. I was already losing hope from the so-called best customer-centric telecom company in India. They are dribbling me to and fro the same way it happens in any other company. As I am a working individual, I could visit their store only after a couple of days. For a couple of time when I visited the store it was closed. I had a chance to visit the store and find it open after a week. I again asked the guy to port my postpaid connection to prepaid, now what I hear is their system is under maintenance. You can guess what I did next. I called customer care just to hear they can not do anything, only Airtel store guy can help me in porting. What do you expect from your customer? Why was there no need to visit your store when I was porting to postpaid????? Should he be wasting this much time and money just to get ignored???????????????????????????</p>
<h2 id="humble-request">Humble Request</h2>
<p>The only request from me is <strong>DO NOT LOOT THE HARD EARNED MONEY</strong> from people. Once, I was a loyal customer who once bought their broadband connection and kept using their services even after changing cities multiple times.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
