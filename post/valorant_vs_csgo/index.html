    <h1 class="title">Face-off: Valorant VS Counter Strike GO</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>Valorant and CS GO are two very similar games, and they do stand out with their unique gameplay
and focus on teamwork. When I heard that Riot is making a new game that is similar to CS GO,
most of us were excited and for a very good reason. CS GO is upwards of 8 years old at this point,
so having a new take on the genre was much overdue. With that being said, there are some things
that make Valorant better, yet at the same time CS GO still holds its value despite being so old.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3cGbpXxPDXZhSXpN6-1viEB5f0-Gx69tQbljJ5TTdwlg8KRTkIeax7ZkWGPJ9PFSIQ-t8mLTeOLvRV939Y4TcR77K5yHMe23kR6lKhYqyGlm_P22KEJ-GIXJPChBnVqbTTbYRPdg5eoqTmCX6uXMaSx9A=w800-h450-no?authuser=0" alt="valorant" title="Valorant"></p>
<h1 id="similarities">Similarities</h1>
<p>The core gameplay is pretty much the same. You have a team that attacks and one that needs to plant
the bomb and defend it. While the names of the teams are different, the idea is for attackers to
kill the defenders before the round ends or before they plant the bomb. If you defend the plant
site or kill the enemies before the round is ending, then you will be able to win. It is the same
core mechanic, so this makes the games rather identical.</p>
<p>Knowledge is required as you play. So you do need to gather information and actively
figure out where the enemies are. That can be the challenging thing, since you do not always
know where they are. On top of that, both games have an accuracy that is sensitive based on movement.
If you shoot while moving, your bullets go all over the place. That is why you need to take your time
and plan every movement and attack if you really want to win. It feels more tedious, but it delivers
on its promise and that is what you want to go for. The hitboxes also matter in both games.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3eUoUbqGFkllwNqWJhYXL2xYqLfGKcPNYZ43iX8uVaBTQB6K2ntmhDMrTeOKc1bHyZsTb0oY0-ssP0S0SSeWStjYBEhkwshj0uHSI052KWJQM5wzxuKaVyi-2VxHN7Gp2UKjY51Z9EnpvJNryEyDtonpA=w934-h526-no?authuser=0" alt="similarity" title="similarity"></p>
<p>What about guns and shields? CS GO is widely known for offering you a vast range of amazing weapons
you can choose and there is plenty of customization options per weapon. On the other hand, you will
see that there are similar weapons in the case of Valorant.</p>
<p>Level design is also very similar. Granted, Valorant has a more cartoony aesthetic, but the truth
is that both of them tend to have corridors, alleyways and just a few open spaces. The idea here
is to bring in a unique perspective and it definitely manages to achieve that in a very creative manner.
It helps you push the boundaries, and it becomes rewarding as well as quite enticing at the same time.
Even the number of tries you get until you win is very similar. You have a game split into multiple
rounds, and the more rounds you win, the better. In the end, the team that wins the most rounds will
win the game. Obviously this is very similar for both Valorant and CS GO, which is why a lot of people
find these two games extremely similar to one another.</p>
<h1 id="what-are-the-differences-between-valorant-and-cs-go">What are the differences between Valorant and CS GO?</h1>
<p>Although the games are quite similar, there are major differences you will find between the two games as well.
Right from the start, the thing that becomes the most striking is the introduction of specific heroes.
They have hero abilities too, aside from the shooting aspect. That makes it easier for you to identify
with a certain character and customize the way you play. That is really immersive and it certainly provides
a lot of potential, which is something to keep in mind. In many ways, Valorant is similar to Overwatch,
but with lots of CS GO ideas in between.</p>
<p>On top of that, Valorant has a very low latency and their servers are extremely powerful. That means you
can get more accurate in the game thanks to the technical side. Of course it may not seem like a lot if
you are near 128 tick servers in Valorant when compared to 64 tick in CS GO, but it is a difference and
you will feel it. That is what makes the two games extremely different to one another. Both games have
anti cheat software, but according to our experience, Valorant did things a little better since it does not
end up increasing the loading time.</p>
<p>Cosmetics are much better in CS GO. Even if Valorant is new, the truth is that offering great cosmetics
is extremely important. Which is why CS GO wins here, because it managed to bring in amazing cosmetics
over the years, and it does stand out. When a game relies on cosmetics for getting any money, you would
expect Valorant to do a lot better.</p>
<p>Also, map design feels better in CS GO. There are tons of different maps to choose from, and they are
always very creative. They are also tested all the time by experts and esports players, so you do have
them adjusted and adapted properly.</p>
<p>I also noticed that balancing is way better in CS GO. It manages to bring in people of the same or very
similar skill level to the point where matches are equal. Valorant tries, but you can still end up with
OP players in the lobby. At that point, all you can do is watch your team get decimated.</p>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3fc6uO6_LDMuYtpE7zj4dbiO4XgRXKNMAmbh4le6a7Ql_RJ1f8Uk5z_zwxFFewU8FHHirLQK9xWmYuNR7di50dDek8lvFJJfc69k6A7sM34gGiTVmXisliK_mBQ8qiKHmaEavu_jqqDuUaQkGukBjGOCw=s512-no?authuser=0" alt="csgo" title="csgo"></p>
<p>Movement also feels more natural in CS GO. Sure, they had a lot of time to refine it, but it feels better,
more comprehensive and the results themselves will be more impressive as you will notice very soon.</p>
<h1 id="which-game-should-you-play">Which game should you play?</h1>
<p>Since both CS GO and Valorant can be played for free in some form or another, it is good to test them out
and see which one you like the most. As a whole, I still believe that CS GO is the better game.
Granted, it had a lot of time to mature and become a better experience, but right now there is a plethora
of content, and it also features a very good ranked mode. Valorant is still learning and they are
introducing some interesting ideas. While it still needs to grow, it can be a viable option.</p>
<p>But if you want to choose one of the two, then CS GO is a good idea, although you can try Valorant as well!</p>
<p>Let me know which one is your favorite.</p>
