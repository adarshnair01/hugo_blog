      <description>Before departing on our trip, we made sure to obtain a visa for entry into Dubai. The process of obtaining a visa online was quick and easy. All we needed was a valid passport and a credit card to pay the visa fee. We got our visa from MakeMyTrip which was very convenient and fast. The visa was issued electronically and we received it within a few days. With this visa, we were able to travel not only to Dubai, but also to other cities within the United Arab Emirates, such as Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.</description>
