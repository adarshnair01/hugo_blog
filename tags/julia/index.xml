      <description>Julia ‚ù§ , The first thing that hits my mind each morning when I wake up is you. Loving you is like an addiction on me. My life, before you came into it, was incomplete. My life has changed completely ever since I met you. Meeting each other, you and I, was not an accident.Before we met each other, our history was written by the Almighty. For this, I thank God everyday from the bottom of my heart!</description>
