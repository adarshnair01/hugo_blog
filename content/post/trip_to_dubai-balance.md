Dubai is an exciting destination for travelers, with its modern architecture, luxury shopping, and vibrant nightlife. But what if you're also working remotely while exploring Dubai? My wife and I recently had the opportunity to do just that, and we learned a lot about how to balance work and travel in this unique destination.

One of the biggest challenges we faced was the time difference. Dubai is 1:30 hours behind India, which meant that we had to start our workday earlier than usual. We found that waking up early and getting a head start on our work was the best way to make the most of the time difference. We were able to finish our workday by 4 PM local time, which was 6 PM in India, and still have plenty of time to explore the city in the evening.

We also had to be mindful of the weather when planning our activities. August is one of the hottest months in Dubai, with temperatures often reaching above 40 degrees Celsius. This made it difficult to roam around the city during the afternoon, so we made sure to schedule our outdoor activities for the morning or the start of the evening when it was cooler. The best thing about this trip was that my birthday was falling the same week and in our company we have a birthday holiday which gave us 2-3 days totally free to roam including Saturday and Sunday. This gave us the perfect opportunity to explore the city and experience the culture.

Finding the right place to work was also crucial. Instead of coworking spaces, we decided to work from our hotels itself. We made sure to book hotels with good connectivity and comfortable work spaces. This proved to be a great decision, as it allowed us to have a comfortable and productive environment to work in. With only 6 days in Dubai, we had to be efficient with our time and plan out our activities carefully. We made sure to prioritize the things we really wanted to see and do, and also left some time for relaxation and rest. We also found that it was helpful to plan out our activities in advance and book tickets or reservations in advance to save time. 

Despite the challenges we faced, we found that working remotely and exploring Dubai in 6 days was a fantastic experience. We were able to combine our work with travel and see a lot of what the city has to offer. We also learned a lot about how to balance work and travel and how to make the most of our time in a new place. If you're considering working remotely and exploring Dubai in a short amount of time, we hope that our experience will give you some tips and inspiration. Remember to be mindful of the time difference and the weather, and to find the right place to work. With a little bit of planning and flexibility, you can have an amazing experience.
