### Intro:
Planning a trip can be a daunting task, but it can also be a fun and exciting experience. Our Malaysia-Singapore trip was no exception. In this blog post, we'll take you through the hilarious story of how we planned our trip, from booking the tickets to deciding on the places to visit.

### Booking the Tickets:
It all started with my wife finding some ridiculously cheap tickets to Singapore for April 2023. We were ecstatic and booked them immediately without even thinking twice. It was like finding a unicorn in a sea of horses. We knew we had to grab it before it disappeared.

### Deciding on the Places to Visit:
Once we had the tickets, we realized that Singapore itself could only take 4-5 days to explore, so we needed to add another place near Singapore to our itinerary. We brainstormed and considered Langkawi, Bali, Vietnam, and Malaysia. After a heated debate and a few glasses of wine, we finally decided on Malaysia.

### Eliminating the Options:
We had to eliminate Vietnam as it was far from Singapore, and we didn't want to spend half of our vacation sitting on a plane. Langkawi was also ruled out because it was similar to Thailand, and we had already planned a trip to Thailand in December. So, it came down to Bali and Malaysia.

### Choosing Malaysia:
The deciding factor was the cost. Malaysia was cheaper than Bali, and we're not made of money. We also had some friends who had already traveled to Malaysia while on their trip to Singapore, and they had only good things to say about the country. We figured if it was good enough for them, it was good enough for us.

### Conclusion:
In this blog post, we've shared the hilarious story of how we planned our Malaysia-Singapore trip. It was a rollercoaster ride of emotions, from the excitement of finding cheap tickets to the wine-fueled debates over which place to visit. We hope this post has given you a good laugh and a glimpse into our crazy planning process. Stay tuned for more posts where we'll share our experiences of exploring Malaysia and Singapore.
