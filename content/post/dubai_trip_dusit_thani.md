My wife and I recently took a trip to Dubai for my birthday, and we had the pleasure of staying at the Dusit Thani Dubai. From the moment we arrived, the experience was nothing short of amazing.

We had booked the hotel in advance, and my wife had made a special request for a birthday cake to be arranged for me. To our surprise, when we arrived at the hotel, a delicious cake was waiting for us in our room. It was a wonderful surprise and the cake tasted amazing.

The hotel itself was luxurious and had all the amenities we needed. We were particularly impressed with the shuttle service that the hotel offered. The shuttle would take guests to popular attractions such as Dubai Mall, Kite Beach, Mall of the Emirates, DIFC, and the Convention Center. On our first evening, we took the shuttle to Dubai Mall and had dinner there. We also got to see the famous fountain show, which was a real highlight of the trip. After spending some quality time at the mall, we booked a cab using Careem, and a Lexus arrived to pick us up.

The next day, we decided to explore the city a bit more, and we were glad that we had a lot of different options to choose from. We could either take the hotel's shuttle service or book a cab using Careem or Uber. We decided to take the hotel's shuttle service to Kite Beach, where we spent the entire day. The beach was beautiful and the weather was perfect. We also got to see some kite surfers, which was a real treat.

Overall, our stay at Dusit Thani Dubai was truly memorable. The staff were friendly and accommodating and the hotel had all the amenities we needed. The surprise birthday cake and shuttle service were added bonuses that made our stay even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Dubai.

Don't just take my word for it, check out this video of our experience at the hotel and around the city
