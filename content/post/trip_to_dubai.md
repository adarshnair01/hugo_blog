Before departing on our trip, we made sure to obtain a visa for entry into Dubai. The process of obtaining a visa online was quick and easy. All we needed was a valid passport and a credit card to pay the visa fee. We got our visa from MakeMyTrip which was very convenient and fast. The visa was issued electronically and we received it within a few days. With this visa, we were able to travel not only to Dubai, but also to other cities within the United Arab Emirates, such as Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.

Our Dubai adventure began with a flight on Etihad Airways, booked through Goibibo. We were excited to finally be embarking on our trip, and we boarded our early morning flight from Bangalore. After a smooth flight, we arrived at Abu Dhabi International Airport at 10am. One of the first things we did upon arriving at the airport was to purchase a local SIM card. The airport had several vendors selling SIM cards at very reasonable prices, and we opted for one that offered unlimited data and the ability to call our hotel. This was a lifesaver as it allowed us to stay connected throughout our trip without incurring any international roaming charges.After completing the immigration process, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a complimentary bus service provided by Etihad that would take us from Abu Dhabi to Dubai. This was a great way to save on transportation costs and also get a glimpse of the beautiful United Arab Emirates landscape during the hour-long ride.

In addition to staying connected with a local SIM card and carrying AED, we also made sure to have an international debit card for any larger purchases. One of our purchases was an iPhone, which we were able to buy using our international debit card, without any issues. However, for smaller purchases and transactions at local shops and street vendors, we found it more convenient to use cash. This way, we were able to easily manage our expenses and avoid any potential complications with foreign transaction fees or currency conversion. We recommend keeping a mix of cash and a card for your trip, as it can make it more convenient for you to make purchases and handle expenses.

After a smooth flight on Etihad Airways and clearing immigration at Abu Dhabi International Airport, we boarded the complimentary bus service to Dubai. The bus dropped us off at the Al Wasl Centre, a convenient location for catching a taxi to our hotel. Our hotel, the Dusit Thani, was just 1km away from the Al Wasl Centre and we reached it in just 10 minutes. We were greeted with warm hospitality and were excited to start our adventure in Dubai. If you're staying in a hotel nearby, this is a great way to reach your hotel quickly and easily, without worrying about navigating the city's busy streets.

Overall, the flight and travel to our hotel was comfortable and enjoyable. We appreciated the complimentary bus service and the smooth process of getting from the airport to our hotel. The availability of a local SIM card at a cheap rate and the ability to carry AED in multiple ways made our experience even more seamless.
