# Why you should visit Munnar
## Echo Point

At an altitude of 600 feet, Echo Point is one of the most serene and beautiful sights Munnar has to offer. Nestled at the merge of three mountain ranges, Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala,  you can enjoy the reverberations of strong echoes that give this place its name. You may also consider boating on the beautiful lake located on the site. Bonus: if you’re a bird watching enthusiast, you may be able to spot native birds in the area.

## Hiking on the Dark Forest Tour

If you’re into spooky places, you should definitely try the dark forest tour. This guided hike takes you into the natural landscape of Munnar. The tree canopy is extremely thick, making it hard for sunlight to break through into the forest. Despite being out in broad daylight, you will trek into the pitch black darkness of the trees. It is a tricky eight-hour hike, more suited to adults than younger kids. The tour also includes a visit to one of Munnar’s famous tea plantations.

## Jeep Safari: Munnar to Vattavada

One of the best things about Munnar is its natural landscapes and rolling green hills. Explore these beautiful sights with a Jeep safari. This expedition will take you through various villages and some of Munnar’s major attractions, including the scenic views of Pampadum Shola National Park. The trip is only three hours, leaving you plenty of time to continue exploring on your own time.

An experienced instructor will guide you safely through the challenging course, which includes ziplines and rope bridges. It’s an exciting and thrilling way to explore the treetops and green vegetation of Munnar.
