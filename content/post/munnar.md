The amazing fact about Munnar is that there aren’t just places to see, there are many things you can be active with in the community. Whether you want to camp or take a tour, you are in luck.

# Why you should visit Munnar
## Echo Point

At an altitude of 600 feet, Echo Point is one of the most serene and beautiful sights Munnar has to offer. Nestled at the merge of three mountain ranges, Mudrapuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala,  you can enjoy the reverberations of strong echoes that give this place its name. You may also consider boating on the beautiful lake located on the site. Bonus: if you’re a bird watching enthusiast, you may be able to spot native birds in the area.

## Hiking on the Dark Forest Tour

If you’re into spooky places, you should definitely try the dark forest tour. This guided hike takes you into the natural landscape of Munnar. The tree canopy is extremely thick, making it hard for sunlight to break through into the forest. Despite being out in broad daylight, you will trek into the pitch black darkness of the trees. It is a tricky eight-hour hike, more suited to adults than younger kids. The tour also includes a visit to one of Munnar’s famous tea plantations.

## Jeep Safari: Munnar to Vattavada

One of the best things about Munnar is its natural landscapes and rolling green hills. Explore these beautiful sights with a Jeep safari. This expedition will take you through various villages and some of Munnar’s major attractions, including the scenic views of Pampadum Shola National Park. The trip is only three hours, leaving you plenty of time to continue exploring on your own time.

## Adventure Rope Course

If you’re feeling a little adventurous, take to the trees in Munnar’s adventure rope course. Fun for people of all ages, the rope course is a great activity for a group! An experienced instructor will guide you safely through the challenging course, which includes ziplines and rope bridges. It’s an exciting and thrilling way to explore the treetops and green vegetation of Munnar.

## Camping at Top Station

What’s an outdoor experience without camping with mountain views? Top Station, the highest point in Munnar,  provides one of the most magical vistas you’ll ever see. The views of craggy mountain peaks breaking through the misty fog will help you connect to nature in an extraordinary way. Enjoy a campfire at the end of the day and share stories of your favorite moments in Munnar. You’ll never forget this one-of-a-kind experience.

## Munnar Tea Trail Tour

One of the main attractions that Munna is known for are its tea plantations. On your visit, make sure to take a day tour and immerse yourself in the culture of the area. You’ll get a chance to walk through the plantation and interact with the people who work on the plantation. This unique experience will give you the chance to learn more about tea production and participate in a tea tasting.

## Bamboo Rafting in Periyar Tiger Reserve  

What better place to enjoy the natural treasures that Munnar has to offer than a tiger reserve? Your adventure begins with a hike through various natural habitats. After your hike, this unique water rafting experience will allow you to explore nature from a different perspective. Trained guides will help you maneuver the raft over the cool waters. You may even spot some wildlife coming to the water’s edge for a drink. This day-long expedition will leave you with a great appreciation of Munnar’s natural beauty.

## India’s Longest Zipline

Remember the rope course? Let’s kick it up a notch and try ziplining! India’s longest zipline is 1800 meters long. Experience a bird’s-eye view of Munnar’s rolling hills and mountain peaks as you zip through the air. Trained instructors are onsite to make sure you have a safe and carefree experience. There’s also a shorter zipline available for beginners.

## Kundala Dam and Lake

If you’re itching to visit another aquatic landscape, make plans to visit the Kundala Dam. About 20 kilometers from Munnar, the Kundala Dam is a perfect place to go pedal boating with your crew. There is also a nearby golf course and waterfall for additional activities to fill your day. If you’re lucky, you may also spot one of the famous Neela Kurunji flowers!

You can’t leave this enchanting paradise without seeing at least one of its spectacular waterfalls. Although the Lakkam waterfalls are about 26 kilometers from Munnar, the view of the water crashing on the rocks is worth the trip.
