Kalman filters are a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system based on a series of measurements. They are widely used in a variety of applications, including navigation, control systems, and signal processing. In this post, we will explore the concept of Kalman filters through a simple example of tracking a moving object using GPS measurements.

## Scenario
Our example scenario is a moving object that we want to track using GPS measurements. We know that the object's position and velocity are changing over time, and we want to estimate the true position and velocity of the object at each time step. To do this, we will use a Kalman filter algorithm.

## Kalman Filter Algorithm
The Kalman filter algorithm consists of two main steps: prediction and update. 

In the prediction step, we use a mathematical model of the system to predict the object's position and velocity at the next time step, based on the current position and velocity. 

In the update step, we use the GPS measurement of the object's position and velocity to update our estimate of the true position and velocity.

## Example
Let's walk through an example of how the Kalman filter algorithm works. 
At time k = 0, we have the first GPS measurement of x(0) = 10 meters and v(0) = 2 m/s. We also have an initial estimate of the object's position and velocity: x(0) = 10 meters and v(0) = 2 m/s. We can use the measurement and the estimate to update the prediction for the next time step.

At time k = 1, we have the next GPS measurement of x(1) = 12 meters and v(1) = 3 m/s. We use this measurement and our prediction from the previous step to update our estimate of the true position and velocity.

At time k = 2, we have the next GPS measurement of x(2) = 14 meters and v(2) = 4 m/s. We use this measurement and our updated estimate from the previous step to update our prediction for the next time step.

This process continues for each time step, with the Kalman filter constantly updating its prediction and estimate based on the new measurements. As the filter iterates, the estimated position and velocity will become more accurate, approaching the true position and velocity of the object. The Kalman filter uses a Gaussian distribution to model the uncertainty of the prediction and the measurement, and the updated estimate will be the center of this Gaussian distribution. The width of the distribution represents the uncertainty, and as the filter iterates, the width of the Gaussian distribution will decrease, indicating that the uncertainty of the estimate is decreasing.

## Conclusion

We have explained the concept of Kalman filters through a simple example of tracking a moving object using GPS measurements. We have also discussed the limitation of standard Kalman filter and how Cubature Kalman filter can overcome it. The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system in the presence of noise and uncertainty. It is widely used in a variety of applications, including navigation, control systems, and signal processing.
