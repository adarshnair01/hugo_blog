      <description>My wife and I recently took a trip to Dubai for my birthday, and we had the pleasure of staying at the Dusit Thani Dubai. From the moment we arrived, the experience was nothing short of amazing.
We had booked the hotel in advance, and my wife had made a special request for a birthday cake to be arranged for me. To our surprise, when we arrived at the hotel, a delicious cake was waiting for us in our room.</description>

      <description>Dubai is an exciting destination for travelers, with its modern architecture, luxury shopping, and vibrant nightlife. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re also working remotely while exploring Dubai? My wife and I recently had the opportunity to do just that, and we learned a lot about how to balance work and travel in this unique destination.
One of the biggest challenges we faced was the time difference. Dubai is 1:30 hours behind India, which meant that we had to start our workday earlier than usual.</description>

      <description>Before departing on our trip, we made sure to obtain a visa for entry into Dubai. The process of obtaining a visa online was quick and easy. All we needed was a valid passport and a credit card to pay the visa fee. We got our visa from MakeMyTrip which was very convenient and fast. The visa was issued electronically and we received it within a few days. With this visa, we were able to travel not only to Dubai, but also to other cities within the United Arab Emirates, such as Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.</description>

      <title>Face-off: Valorant VS Counter Strike GO</title>

      <description>Valorant and CS GO are two very similar games, and they do stand out with their unique gameplay and focus on teamwork. When I heard that Riot is making a new game that is similar to CS GO, most of us were excited and for a very good reason. CS GO is upwards of 8 years old at this point, so having a new take on the genre was much overdue.</description>

      <description>Because of current technology advances, machine learning nowadays is able to make decision close to what human would make, on its own. It was birthed from pattern recognition and the belief that computers will teach without being programmed to accomplish particular tasks; researchers involved in artificial intelligence needed to think if computers would learn from data. This repetitive view of machine learning is crucial because as models are exposed to current information, they are able to independently change.</description>

      <title>Every coin has two sides. So does Airtel</title>

      <description>I am very disappointed with the service that Airtel Customer care have provided and equally disappointed with the service I have received from their store. They’re literally looting my money and I have to wait for their help because there’s nothing that I can do, other than posting it online.
Journey on Pushpak Viman To Postpaid Here’s what I have been through after I thought to move to postpaid. Once I checked Airtel’s website and came to know they have good plans in postpaid with very high data usage which can be used, I tried registering for an airtel postpaid connection online.</description>
